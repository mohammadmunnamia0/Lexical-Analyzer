# **Lexical Analyzer in C**

This program demonstrates a simple **Lexical Analyzer** in C. It processes a mathematical expression and breaks it into **tokens**, categorizing each token into a type such as **NUMBER**, **OPERATOR**, **IDENTIFIER**, or **PARENTHESIS**.

---

## **Program Description**

### **What is a Lexical Analyzer?**
A **Lexical Analyzer** is a part of a compiler or interpreter that processes input code or expressions and divides them into small meaningful components called **tokens**. 

For example, in the expression:

```
( 12 + x * ( y - 25 ) / z ) % 15
```

The tokens would be:

- **Token**: `(`, **Type**: `PARENTHESIS`
- **Token**: `12`, **Type**: `NUMBER`
- **Token**: `+`, **Type**: `OPERATOR`
- and so on...

### **Purpose of This Program**
This program analyzes a given expression and prints each token along with its type in a structured format. It is designed for **beginners in programming** to understand the basics of lexical analysis.

## **How to Run the Program**

### **Requirements**
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- A terminal or IDE to run the program.

### **Steps to Compile and Run**
1. Save the code in a file named `lexical_analyzer.c`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
3. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   gcc lexical_analyzer.c -o lexical_analyzer
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./lexical_analyzer
   ```

## **Input and Output**

### **Input**
The input is hardcoded in the program. For this example, the expression is:

```
( 12 + x * ( y - 25 ) / z ) % 15
```

You can modify the input expression by changing the value of the `expression` variable in the code.

### **Output**
The program will analyze the expression and produce the following output:

```
Analyzing Expression: ( 12 + x * ( y - 25 ) / z ) % 15

Token: (         Type: PARENTHESIS
Token: 12        Type: NUMBER
Token: +         Type: OPERATOR
Token: x         Type: IDENTIFIER
Token: *         Type: OPERATOR
Token: (         Type: PARENTHESIS
Token: y         Type: IDENTIFIER
Token: -         Type: OPERATOR
Token: 25        Type: NUMBER
Token: )         Type: PARENTHESIS
Token: /         Type: OPERATOR
Token: z         Type: IDENTIFIER
Token: )         Type: PARENTHESIS
Token: %         Type: OPERATOR
Token: 15        Type: NUMBER
```

## **Code Overview**

### **Key Features**
- **Tokenization**:
  - Numbers (`12`, `25`, `15`) are identified as **NUMBER**.
  - Operators (`+`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `-`) are identified as **OPERATOR**.
  - Parentheses (`(`, `)`) are identified as **PARENTHESIS**.
  - Letters (`x`, `y`, `z`) are identified as **IDENTIFIER**.
- **Input Handling**: The program ignores spaces and groups multi-digit numbers (e.g., `25`).

### **How It Works**
1. The program reads the hardcoded expression.
2. It loops through each character in the expression:
   - Checks if the character is a number, operator, parenthesis, or identifier.
   - Prints the token and its type.
3. Outputs all tokens with their respective types.

## **Customizing the Code**

- To analyze a different expression:
  - Change the value of the `expression` variable in the program:
    ```c
    const char expression[] = "( your expression here )";
    ```
- Examples of valid expressions:
  - `( 5 + a * ( b - 10 ) / c ) % 3`
  - `x + y * 12 / ( 5 - z )`

---

## **Common Errors and Solutions**

1. **Error: `gcc` not found**
   - Ensure you have GCC installed. Use:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install gcc       # For Ubuntu/Debian
     brew install gcc           # For macOS
     ```
2. **Expression Not Printing Correctly**
   - Ensure the expression is a valid mathematical expression with spaces separating each component.
